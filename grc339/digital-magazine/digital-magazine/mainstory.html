        <h3>Soup-inion Column: Chicken or Veggie Broth?</h3>
        <p>Stock plays a vital role in several dishes. It can serve as the base for different kinds of sauces, soups, braises, gravies, and so much more. The primary purpose stock is to help you build the layers of flavor in your recipe – giving you that rich and distinct taste. Needless to say, chicken and vegetables are the most commonly used ingredients for stocks.</p>
        <p>This leads us to the matter at hand: Vegetable stock vs chicken stock – what’s the difference? The short answer to that is flavor. Chicken stock is made from chicken and vegetables, while vegetable stock is made only with vegetables. This difference produces specific flavor profiles as well as a variety of nutritional benefits for each type of stock. In this article, we’ll be delving deeper into the differences between these two types of stocks. We’ll also look into the best ways you can make them as well as some storage tips you need to try. </p>

        <p>So, before we discuss the difference between a vegetable and a chicken stock, you, my dear readers, first need to understand what stock is and why you should use it (you might already know these things, in which case, you can skip to the next section).The main purpose of stock as a culinary tool is to provide a dish with a flavor base to build on. This is why they are commonly used for making gravy, soups, and other dishes that require reduction.</p>
        <p>So, having a batch of stock in your freezer presents a myriad of possibilities as you have one of the most fundamental ingredients for a tasty and nutritious meal. Making stock is the most efficient way to bring out the natural juices of your ingredients. That said, the process of making stock is extractive in nature as you are getting all the flavors out of them. This basic rule applies whether you are using chicken or any kind of vegetable. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Now that we understand the purpose of making stock as well as the benefits that come with it, we need to talk about the matter at hand. Which is better? Chicken stock has a much richer flavor. This is because of all the gelatin that you were able to extract while making your chicken stock. This is also the same reason why it would be better to use chicken stock when making gravy as you want it to have a meatier taste that would otherwise be impossible with vegetable stock. On the other hand, basic vegetable stock is not designed to serve as the star of the dish. That is why people often opt to use vegetables with a neutral but savory flavor profile. The flavors of a good vegetable stock should remain in the background, enriching the whole experience, instead of overpowering it. This is what makes the combination of carrots, celery, onions, and mushrooms so perfect for making stock. With all this in mind, our answer is: it depends.</p>
