            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>SOUPER DOUPER ORG. </h3><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Soup is more than a food group– it is a way of life. Created to combat the mainstream narrative that soup is just a food for the sick, old, and gumless, Souper Douper org. aims to promote soups of all cultures through recipes, challenges, and our Soup History column. Our Souper Douper subscription allows readers to delve deeper into the bowl and get to the good parts.</p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
